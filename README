# Notepad 📝

**Notepad** is a simple and intuitive note-taking web application that combines the functionality of traditional notepads with to-do list features. Designed for efficiency and ease of use, it helps users stay organized whether they’re jotting down quick notes or managing tasks.

## Why I Built It

I created Notepad to improve my front-end development skills while building something practical and useful. I wanted a lightweight, distraction-free tool that could serve as both a simple notepad and a task manager. This project allowed me to explore UI design with Tailwind CSS and reinforce my JavaScript knowledge through real-world functionality.
